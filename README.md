To run this application you first need to start the server. This is done, in my case, by right clicking on the folder wheere the application is located and clicking gitBash. After this is done, type node server.

This will start the server so communication can begin. Open your browser and type in localhst: 3005 (app listening on port 3005)

Once this has been done the user will be prompted to enter thier username. When other users log on, communication can begin.
